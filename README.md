# TeachOverflows

This is a collection of buffer overflow challenges intended to 
demonstrate the basic concepts. Compile as-is or add your own 
custom flags by updating flags.txt in the scripts folder
and running 'scripts/makeflags.sh'.

These programs are intentionally vulnerable and should not be exposed 
directly to a network the intention is to have them attacked.

## Requirements
- Python
- Linux with base development tools installed (gcc, make, etc)
- gcc-multilib if compiling on a x64 machine
- optional: docker

## Instructions

Clone the repo:

`$ git clone https://github.com/MyBagofTricks/TeachOverflows.git`

### Using make

`make` 

### Using Docker

`docker build -t teach . && docker run -p 80:80 --hostname=TeachOverFlows -p2222:22 -it teach`

- Default ssh user/pass is: overflow:overflow
- Password can be updated by replacing the hash in scripts/runDocker.sh
- Create scripts/authorized_keys with a public key to skip passwords completely


## The Game

| Level     |   Type   |   Hint    |
| ----------| ---------|-----------|
| level01   | Practice | Enter 60 characters |
| level02   | Practice | Enter the string at the correct offset |
| level03   | Practice | Enter the strings at the correct offsets |
| level04   | BOF      | Enter the string, and overwrite the variable |
| level05   | BOF      | Overflow the buffer and call winner() |
| level06   | BOF      | Overflow the buffer and call winner() |
| level07   | Format   | Overwrite the variable with the string, using less than 10 chars |
| level08   | Format   | Overwrite the variable with 512 |
| level09   | Format   | Overwrite the variable with 0xCAFEF00D |
| level10   | ROP      | Call the function with the correct argument |
| level11   | ROP      | Call the first function with the correct arguments, then call 'winner' |
| level12   | Heap     | Just like a buffer overflow |

## Notes

If compiling challenges manually with gcc, use '-fno-stack-protector -no-pie' to
disable Address Space Layout Randomization and stack protections. Disabling
globally can be done to simplify attacks on libc.

Execute as root to disable ASLR globally:

`echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`


## Your "encryption" is bad!
Correct. Reversing it should be easy homework.
